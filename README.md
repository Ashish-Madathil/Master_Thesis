# Master Thesis : “Domain Adaptation of Synthetic Generated Omnidirectional Images for Object Detection”

• Coded models in Python and incorporated APIs in PyTorch to improve the Photorealism of synthetic images by Style transfer beyond 30% average precision in object detection (for 7 classes)

• Style transfer (Domain Adaptation) using High-Resolution Network and VGG19 CNN architecture with PyTorch

• Synthetic image data set generated from the Unity 3D engine for training

• Evaluation of photorealism on pre-trained SSD for object recognition with Tensorflow
